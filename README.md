# Time Management System

This simple app is to demonstrate following features / technical perspectives:

Features
* Users can log their task with date and hour
* Users can set their preferred working hour
* Users can check if he or she has done more or less work for the day with the color code
* Admin can manage users and tasks (of regular users)

Ruby on Rails
* REST API
* Token-based authentication
* Tests for above

AngularJS
* Consumes the API to display data
* Distributed from Rails but independent from it

Thanks!
